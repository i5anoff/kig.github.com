      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I like making applications and demos that look good. As one might imagine, this also leads me into visual arts like illustration, photography and graphic design.</p>
      <p>
      <p>Another interest of mine is managing large amounts of information. Thus far, this has manifested in zoomable file managers. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy2RMqe_iXg">Here's a video</a> of a web-based prototype I wrote. The UI is HTML.</p>
      <p>Filezoo is another zoomable file manager I wrote a year later, this time for the local filesystem using Gtk# and Cairo. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itsOMpMpPto">Here's</a> a video of Filezoo in action.</p>

      <h4>Code on the web</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://fhtr.org">Links to work and projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/kig">My GitHub repos</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://cakejs.googlecode.com">Cake.js</a> - a HTML Canvas scene graph (with a partial SVG renderer implementation)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Programming languages</h4>
      <p>Several years of use (10+ thousand lines): JavaScript, OCaml, Ruby</p>
      <p>Basic proficiency (5-10 thousand lines): C#, C/C++, Haskell</p>
      <p>Beginner (&lt;5 thousand lines): OpenCL, GLSL, Python, Go</p>
      <p>Rusty: PHP, Java</p>

      <h4>Web technologies</h4>
      <p>WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, HTML, some XHTML, CSS</p>
